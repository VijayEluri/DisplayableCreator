<h2 id="principle">Principle</h2>

<p>The aim of the Displayable creator is to create Displayable and to
allow you to open and view Displayables. A Displayable is created from
a usually big image.</p>

<p>Once the Displayable Creator is launched, just drop images on the main
window to create Displayables, or drop Displayables to view them.</p>

<h2 id="mainwindow">Main Window</h2>

<p><img src="img/main.png"></p>

<p>The main window give access to all the functionality of the app. </p>

<ul>
<li>the checkbox enable or disable sharing of Displayables over the network.</li>
<li>the list icon gives access to the list of Displayables and images
 (queued for transformation into Displayables).</li>
<li>the wrench icon gives access to the preferences for the app.</li>
<li>the &#8216;?&#8217; icon gives access to this very document.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="preferences">Preferences</h2>

<p><img src="img/prefs.png"></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Sharing port</em>: the network port on your machine from which the
 Displayable Creator will serve the Displayable to your
 Displayator-running iOS devices. This port need to be open in your
 firewall.</li>
<li><em>Activate on startup</em>: when ticked, the Displayable creator will
 start the network sharing functionality when launching.</li>
<li><em>Tile Size</em>: A Displayable stores a copy of the original image cut
 in tiles that can be quickly accessed. This allow you to choose the
 tile size. Bigger tiles means less tiles to show. However, bigger
 tiles might take more time to load on older device. Tooltips
 indicate suggested usage for each tile size.</li>
<li><em>Check for update on startup</em>: as it says :-).</li>
<li><em>Check now</em>: will immediately check for update. Also, if you
 previously clicked on &#8220;ignore [version]&#8221;, that version will no
 longer be ignored (until ignored again).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="displayableimagelist">Displayable &amp; Image List</h2>

<p><img src="img/list.png"></p>

<p>This list contains the images queued for transformation into
Displayable, and the Displayables ready for sharing over the local
network. Sharing is enabled/disabled on the main screen.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <em>floppy-disk icon</em> marks that the Displayable is unsaved,
meaning that it will be destroyed when you quit the app. Click on it
to view the save dialog (see bellow).</li>
<li>The <em>pencil icon</em> indicate the Displayable has already been
 saved. Clicking on it will popup the save/edit dialog (see bellow).</li>
<li>Clicking on the <em>eye icon</em> will activate the Displayable viewer
 window, loading it with the selected Displayable.</li>
<li>Clicking on the <em>x icon</em> allows you to remove the Displayable or
 queued image from the list. If the Displayable is unsaved, removing
 it from the list will remove it from its temporary place on your
 hard drive.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="theeditsavedialog">The Edit / Save dialog</h2>

<p><img src="img/save.png"></p>

<p>The Edit/Save dialog allows you to change the title of the
Displayable, its file name, and you can add a description.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <em>title</em> is the name of the Displayable as it will appear in the
Displayator app on your iOS device.</li>
<li>The <em>save as</em> field contains the file name of the Displayable,
 without the file extension.
 your Displayable in.</li>
<li>The <em>in directory</em> field contains the directory you want to save</li>
<li>The <em>description</em> will appear on the download screen of the
 Displayable app, on top of a miniature of the image.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="viewingdisplayables">Viewing Displayables</h2>

<p><img src="img/view.png"></p>

<p>When you click on the <em>eye</em> icon in the Displayable list, the viewer
will appear with the selected Displayable. Clicking on the looking
glasses with + and - will zoom and de-zoom the Displayable.</p>

<p>You can move the view around by dragging the image.</p>

<!--- clicking on the diagonal expanding arrows will make the view go full-screen.-->
