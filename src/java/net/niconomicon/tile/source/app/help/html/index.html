<h4 id="principle">Principle</h4>

<p>The aim of the displayable creator is to create displayable and to
open Displayables. A displayable is created from a usually big image.</p>

<p>Once the displayable Creator is launched, just drop images on the main
window to create Displayables, or drop Displayables to view them.</p>

<h4 id="mainwindow">Main Window</h4>

<p><img src="img/main.png"></p>

<p>The main window give access to all the functionality of the app. </p>

<ul>
<li>the checkbox enable or disable sharing of displayables over the network.</li>
<li>the list icon gives access to the list of Displayables and images
 (queued for transformation into Displayables).</li>
<li>the wrench icon gives access to the pgenreference for the app.</li>

<li><em>Sharing port</em>: the network port on your machine from which the
 Displayable Creator will serve the displayable to your
 Displayator-running iOS devices. This port need to be open in your
 firewall.</li>
<li><em>Activate on startup</em>: when ticked, the displayable creator will
 start the network sharing functionality when launching.</li>
<li><em>Tile Size</em>: A displayable stores a copy of the original image cut
 in tiles that can be quickly accessed. This allow you to choose the
 tile size. Bigger tiles means less tiles to store, which means a
 smaller displayable. However, bigger tiles take more time to load on
 the iOS device. Tooltips indicate suggested usage for each tile
 size.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="displayableimagelist">Displayable &amp; Image List</h4>

<p><img src="img/list.png"></p>

displayable, and the displayables ready for sharing over the local

 the list. if the displayable is unsaved, removing it from the list
 will remove it from its temporary place on your hard drive.</li>
