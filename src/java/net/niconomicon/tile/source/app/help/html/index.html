<p>The aim of the Displayable creator is to create Displayable and to
allow you to open and view Displayables. A Displayable is created from
a usually big image.</p>

window to create Displayables, or drop Displayables to view them.</p>

<p>Dropping images on the central area will queue them to be transformed
into Displayables. Currently supported format are BMP, PNG, GIF and
JPEG (except for YCMB jpegs). Size was tested up to 466 Megapixels
(21600x21600).</p>
