<h4 id="principle">Principle</h4>

<p>The aim of the displayable creator is to create displayable and to
open Displayables. A displayable is created from a usually big image.</p>

<p>Once the displayable Creator is launched, just drop images on the main
window to create Displayables, or drop Displayables to view them.</p>

<h4 id="mainwindow">Main Window</h4>

<p><img src="img/main.png"></p>

<p>The main window give access to all the functionality of the app. </p>

<ul>
<li>the checkbox enable or disable sharing of displayables over the network.</li>
<li>the list icon gives access to the list of Displayables and images
 (queued for transformation into Displayables).</li>
<li>the wrench icon gives access to the preference for the app.</li>
<li>the help icon gives access to this very document.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="preferences">Preferences</h4>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Sharing port</em>: the network port on your machine from which the Displayable Creator will serve the displayable to your Displayator-running iOS devices. This port need to be open in your firewall.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Activate on startup</em>: when ticked, the displayable creator will start the network sharing functionality when launching.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tile Size</em>: A displayable stores a copy of the original image cut in tiles that can be quickly accessed. This allow you to choose the tile size. Bigger tiles means less tiles to store, which means a smaller displayable. However, bigger tiles take more time to load on the iOS device. Tooltips indicate suggested usage for each tile size.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="displayableimagelist">Displayable &amp; Image List</h4>

<p><img src="img/list.png"></p>

displayable, and the displayables ready for sharing over the local
network. Sharing is enabled/disabled on the main screen.</p>
